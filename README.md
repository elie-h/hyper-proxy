Janus Proxy 🌐

Welcome to Janus Proxy, a secure, performant, and observable HTTPs proxy server, designed to empower developers with a clear understanding of their network traffic while maintaining the highest security standards.

Why Janus Proxy? 🤔
Named after Janus, the Roman god of gates, transitions, and passages, our proxy stands as a metaphorical gatekeeper to your network, managing the flow of information that comes in and out.

Key Features 🚀

- Uncompromised Security: We support HTTPS exclusively to encrypt all data that flows through Janus, ensuring the confidentiality of your information.
- Seamless Observability: Gain valuable insights into your network's API requests and responses. Janus Proxy lets you understand what's happening under the hood.
- Non-Intrusive: Janus uses the CONNECT method, establishing a secure tunnel between the client and server. It sees the start and end of the connections but not the actual data, ensuring your sensitive information remains private.
